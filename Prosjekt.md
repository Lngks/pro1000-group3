Artificial Intelligence is rapidly becoming part of students’ everyday learning—from summarising textbooks to generating study notes, practice questions, and explanations. At the same time, students often feel uncertain about what is allowed, how to use AI responsibly, and how to protect their privacy. Teachers and universities also struggle to provide clear guidance that is consistent, ethical, and easy to understand. Your team will develop a functional website called AIGuidebook, designed for students at university level. The goal of the website is to give students simple, trustworthy guidance on how to use AI tools in their studies in a safe, responsible, and academically honest way.

General Needs & Background Students need clear rules and examples of acceptable vs. unacceptable AI use. They need help understanding privacy, data protection, hallucination risks, and academic integrity. Universities want consistency between teachers and across study programmes. Teachers want ready-made explanations, examples, and practical tips they can share with students. Institutions need a reference point that supports responsible AI literacy. Relevant Stakeholders Primary users: Students (first-year and continuing students) Secondary users: Teachers, academic advisors, study administration

Project stakeholders: Project team (your group), course lecturer, IT support staff Indirect stakeholders: Educational policymakers, exam committees, data protection officers

Initial Requirements (Starting Points) The AIGuidebook should: Provide students with guidance on responsible AI use. Explain risks connected to privacy, bias, hallucinations, and academic integrity. Contain simple examples, checklists, and explanations. Be accessible, readable, and easy to navigate. Look visually clean and appropriate for an educational website. Be responsive for desktop and mobile. Include at least one interactive element (e.g., FAQ, checklist, or mini-tutorial).

Constraints Must be developed within the course timeline, using teamwork and agile methods. Must be a functional website (not just wireframes or mockups). Must have publicly accessible content (no login required). Must include proper citations when using external sources. Must follow basic accessibility and usability principles.
